Data visualization pipeline to provide insights into the data. Binary classification algorithms are used for automated detection. Univariate feature selection to identify significant differentiators.\n\n\nA Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed for binary Binary classification where ADHD is there or not\n\n\n\nAcademic Publication-2\n\n\nThe research study proposes a machine learning-based approacg for the automated detection of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using EEG signal data.\n\n\nThe study includes 117 adults, comprising 67 individuals with ADHD and 50 controls. EEG measurements are collected under four different conditions: two resting conditions (eyes open and eyes closed) and two neuropsychological tasks (visual continuous performance test and emotional continuous performance test).\n\n\nApproach\n\n\n\n\nThe study uses EEG signal data.\n\n\nFour different SVM classifiers are trained, one for each data set corresponding to the four conditions mentioned above\n\n\nThe output of the four SVM classifiers is combined using a logical expression derived from the Karnaugh map, which is a technique for simplifying Boolean algebraic expressions. This ensemble approach is used to combine the results of the individual classifiers.\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe study concludes that this ensemble approach improves the discrimination between\n\n\n\nADHD and control groups: It enhances the ability to distinguish between individuals with ADHD and those without.\n\n\nADHD subtypes: It improves the classification of different subtypes within the ADHD group.\n\n\nThe results suggest that this approach enhances the discrimination between ADHD and control groups as well as among different ADHD subtypes. It demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques for assisting in the diagnosis and subtype classification of ADHD in adults based on EEG data.\n\n\n\nsummarize the topic\n\n\nDevelop machine learning models to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of ADHD in children or adults based on behavioral data, neuropsychological assessments, or other relevant data sources.\n\n\nwhy it is important\n\n\nEarly detection of ADHD is crucial for effective intervention and treatment. Machine learning-based systems can potentially identify ADHD in its early stages, allowing for timely interventions and support for individuals, especially children, who may benefit from early treatment.\n\n\nwhy the reader should continue\n\n\nwhat work has been done in the past by other research groups\n\n\nIn 2020, A Machine-Based Prediction Model of ADHD Using CPT Data has been done. To address some of the known shortcomings of traditional analysis and interpretation of CPT data, the present study applied a machine learning-based model (ML) using CPT indices for the Prediction of ADHD.Using a retrospective factorial fitting, followed by a bootstrap technique, we trained, cross-validated, and tested learning models on CPT performance data of 458 children aged 6–12 years ,213 children with ADHD and 245 typically developed children.\n\n\nwhat are the “different points of views”/interpretations in the literature\n\n\nCPT data is being used in the dataset to detect the ADHD. where is in the above mentioned academic publication pupillometry data is being used.\n\nwhat are you exploring\n\n\nI would like to explore the use of various data sources, including neuroimaging data (e.g., fMRI, EEG), behavioral assessments, genetic data, and clinical notes. read ore than different approaches and data considered to detect ADHD using ML.\n\n\nwhat are your goals and hypothesis\n\n\nHypothesis 1 (Main hypothesis)\nML-based models can significantly improve the accuracy of ADHD diagnosis compared to traditional clinical assessments.\n\n\nHypothesis 2 (Early Detection)\nML models can detect early signs of ADHD in children, allowing for intervention before symptoms become severe.\n\n\nINTERNAL ACADEMIC CITATIONS\n\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nBig data and computing\n\n\nyou use the author’s name in the text: Garza (2007) noted that although cats appear to be more intelligent than dogs, dogs actually use similar problem-solving strategies.\nyou use the author’s name in the text: Garza (2007) noted that although cats appear to be more intelligent than dogs, dogs actually use similar problem-solving strategies.\n\n10 QUESTIONS TO PLAN ON ANSWERING\n\n\n\nWhat Preprocessing Steps are necessary during data cleaning stage\n\n\nWhat are the factors affecting the ADHD\n\n\nwhat are the attributes to be considered for the dataset\n\n\nwhich machine learning algorithm is best suitable for this problem\n\n\nwhat are the different machine learning solutions to this problem\n\n\nwhat are the different machine learning solutions to this problem\n\n\nwhat are the best sources to find pupillometry data.\n\n\nwhat are the different types of data that can considered to detect ADHD.\n\n\nWhat Are the ethical and privacy Concerns? to be considered while collecitng sensitive data regarding adhd\n\n\nWhat Is the Real-World Applicability of this algorithm? which age group is suffering the most and would require a data science solution to detect ADHD\n\n\n\nCITATIONS\n\n(9841277?)\nDas, W., Khanna, S.
